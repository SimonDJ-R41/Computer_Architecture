# Computer_Architecture
This repository is meant for tasks in the course, DM548.

Reminder when using (if one would) to not include the ".asm", since it'd then be deleted (unknown reason, looking into fixing it).

Simply in Linux:
./asm_compiler project name, without ".asm"
To run the project:
./project name
